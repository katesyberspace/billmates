# billmates

billsmates and a no frills app to split bills with your mates! Works best for long weekend trips where Bob might pay for the fuel, Jane might pay for Friday dinner, and Joe pays for the booze, etc.  Users can create bills, with a unique pin so friends can join the bill. As items are added, the app will automatically calculat who needs to pay what.  All members of the bill can also make memories of the event by leaving comments.
